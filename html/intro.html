		WikiMapper works by passively tracking your link-clicking activity within Wikipedia pages and plots the 
		gathered history data on a tree visualization.

	<p>
		You don't have to do anything special to use WikiMapper. Open a new tab or window and start browsing on
		wikipedia.org. When you wish to see the graph of your stumblings, click on the WikiMapper icon in your browser toolbar or return to this tab and refresh the page!
