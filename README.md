### WikiMapper: A Chrome extension to map your Wikipedia navigation.

WikiMapper creates a historical tree of your Wikipedia browsing so that you can see just exactly how you spontaneously wasted 45 minutes and ended up reading about the history of Agriculture in Uzbekistan.

Think of WikiMapper as a solution to the problem described so well in [this xkcd comic.](http://www.xkcd.com/214)

WikiMapper is available for free in the Chrome Web Store! [Click here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikimapper/feiheebgoilmbkaddngcoocjbogfchlb?hl=en&gl=US)
